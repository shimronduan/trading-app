# üöÄ Quick GitHub Setup Guide (Production Environment)

Since you're using GitHub Environments, here's exactly what you need to configure:

## üìã Required GitHub Environment Configuration

### Environment Setup
1. Go to **Settings > Environments**
2. Make sure you have an environment named **"production"**
3. Add the variables and secrets below to the **production** environment

### Environment Variables (in production environment)

Add these **2 variables**:

```
AZURE_ENV_NAME=trading-app-prod
AZURE_LOCATION=eastus
```

### Environment Secrets (in production environment)

Add these **6 secrets** to the **production** environment:

**Azure Authentication (your complete JSON):**
```
AZURE_CREDENTIALS={"clientId":"********-****-****-****-************","clientSecret":"********************************","subscriptionId":"********-****-****-****-************","tenantId":"********-****-****-****-************","activeDirectoryEndpointUrl":"https://login.microsoftonline.com","resourceManagerEndpointUrl":"https://management.azure.com/","activeDirectoryGraphResourceId":"https://graph.windows.net/","sqlManagementEndpointUrl":"https://management.core.windows.net:8443/","galleryEndpointUrl":"https://gallery.azure.com/","managementEndpointUrl":"https://management.core.windows.net/"}
```

**Application Environment Variables:**

## üîç Deployment Process

1. **Build**: Compiles your Next.js app
2. **Deploy**: Uses production environment variables
3. **Provision**: Creates Azure resources with Terraform (FREE!)
4. **Deploy**: Uploads your app to Azure App Service

Your app will be available at: `https://your-app-name.azurewebsites.net`

## üîí Environment Benefits
